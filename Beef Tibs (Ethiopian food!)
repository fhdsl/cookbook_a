Ingredients
2 Tbsp vegetable oil (or Ethiopian niter kibbeh)
1½ cups medium yellow onion, finely chopped (1/2 medium-sized onion)
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1½ Tbsp berbere
2 Tbsp water
2 Roma tomatoes, diced
1 lb beef (eye of round roast), cut into ½ inch cubes
1 tsp iodine salt
2 jalapeños, deseeded and sliced
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
Instructions
In a nonstick skillet heat oil over high heat. When the oil easily slides across the pan, add the onions and garlic. Cook for about 4 minutes until the onions become translucent. Stir often so the garlic doesn’t burn.
Add tomatoes and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Sprinkle with berbere and 2 tablespoons of water reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 5 more minutes, stirring often.
Add beef and mix well until the meat cubes are well coated with gravy. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the meat is well cooked.If the gravy is too thick you can add another tablespoon of water.
Add salt, jalapenos, and rosemary. Give it a last stir and let it cook for 3 more minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. If the gravy isn't spicy enough you can add more berbere.
Serve beef tibs on injera bread with a side of Misir Wot (Ethiopian lentils) and gomen (Ethiopian collard greens – coming soon).
