# red lentil soup NYT

3 Tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced (*)
1 Tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp kosher salt, more to taste
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
pinch ground chile powder, more to taste
1 quart of good-quality chicken stock
(we're leaving out the added water)
1 cup red lentils
1 large carrot, peeled & diced
juice of 1 lemon (*)
3 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro (not too much)

In a large pot, heat 3 Tbsp oil over high heat until shimmering. Add onion and garlic. Saute until golden, about 4 min.

Stir in tomato paste, cumin, salt, black pepper, and chile powder. Saute another 2 min.

Add stock, lentils, and carrot. Bring to simmer, then cover and turn heat to medium-low. Simmer until lentils are soft, about 30 min. Taste and add salt if needed.

Puree soup with immersion blender. Don't over-blend: soup should be somewhat chunky.

Stir in lemon juice and cilantro.
