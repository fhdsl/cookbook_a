Instructions
Preheat oven to 180°F/350°F (160°C fan).
Mix the spice ingredients in a bowl then set aside.
Brown lamb: toss lamb with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large oven-proof dutch oven (with a lid) over high heat. Brown the lamb in 3 batches, turning to colour the pieces all over, about 3 minutes. Remove into a bowl, then repeat with remaining lamb. Set aside.
Aromatics: Turn heat down to medium high. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes until soft. Add tomato paste, ginger, cinnamon and spice mix. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Sauce: Add chicken stock and water, stir, then return the lamb into the pot.
Slow cook: Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid then cook in the oven for 45 minutes. Add apricots, put the lid back on and cook for another 1 hour, checking halfway to ensure the sauce hasn't reduced all the way (if you're concerned, add 1/2 cup water).
Lemon finish: Lamb should be tender – check! Gently stir in lemon zest. Serve over couscous, sprinkled with toasted almonds and coriander.
